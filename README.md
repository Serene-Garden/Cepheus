# Cepheus
A powerful watchOS full-keyboard.

![:name](https://count.getloli.com/get/@Garden785-Cepheus?theme=rule34)

As the release of Apple Watch Series 7, full-keyboard seems to be quite useless. But old series such as Series 5 or SEs are still unable to type freely.

We developed Cepheus, allowing all users to type with a full-keyboard.

It supports English and Simplified Chinese Pinyin.
